# ECG-TransNet-Arrhythmia-Detection
ECG-TransNet implementation focused on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia &amp; AFDB datasets. Features a hybrid 1D-CNN &amp; Transformer architecture for high-accuracy beat classification (AAMI standards). Includes specialized preprocessing for noise reduction, R-peak detection, and SHAP-based explainability for clinical validation of arrhythmia predictions.
